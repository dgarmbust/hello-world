Introduction
My name is Don. I am a (semi) retired electrical engineer.  I have been programming computers since the 1970’s (Fortran and machine language, anyone?). About five years ago I got interested in the Arduino series of computer boards. I started playing around with them and making little “effects” on a bread-board set up. 
Next, I was finding that I could them to control “talking” greeting cards, and other such devices. My hobby then grew from there.
I put boards (Nanos) into plastic pumpkins and had them create fake candlelight. I then discovered the MP3 boards, and had the pumpkins play music and recordings. (I will add videos to this folder.)
My largest project, so far, has been a Christmas display for our home. It consists of some collectable ceramics from my in-laws with lighting and music. The most dramatic section is synchronous lights with “The nutcracker”.  At the end of the affair, a Santa in his sleigh sweeps across the sky.
I am now working on two items:
1)	A talking pumpkin with EL wire to articulate the face. My ultimate goal is to get the hardware small enough to fit inside a mid-size pumpkin.
2)	Create a “Star Wars” style light sabre that has an expanding/contracting cone to emulate the movie version.
I will add both these projects to GitHub in the very near future.
Feel free to comment or assist.
